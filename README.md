# CSS | Slack clone with Flexbox

## Introduction

You should be reaaaaally familiar with [Slack](https://www.slack.com/) at this point, but just to make it more clear, **Slack** is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services or in simpler terms, it is a chatting program.

We use the app almost every day to keep our communications with our classmates and the **Ironhack** team, so we know perfectly the chat interface but today we are going to clone their landing page. [Here](https://www.slack.com/) you can visit the website and check what are we going to do. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

We want to practice our new **Flexbox** skills, so we are going to implement the *"responsiveness"* of the landing page. No worries, we will show you what we need!


## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Exercise

You are provided with the basic files: HTML, CSS and required images.

Also you will find  the `reference.jpg` file, where you can see in detail the expected composition for every size, matching `sm`, `md` and `lg` Bootstrap's breakpoints.

Reminder: **Mobile first!**

Happy coding! ❤️
